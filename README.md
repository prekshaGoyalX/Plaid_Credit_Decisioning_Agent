Plaid-Powered Credit Decisioning Agent
======================================
B2B Demo: How lenders (fintechs, banks, credit unions) use Plaid's 
infrastructure to build autonomous underwriting agents.

This prototype demonstrates the agent lifecycle:
1. PERCEIVE - Fetch financial data via Plaid APIs
2. REASON - Analyze cash flow, income stability, debt ratios
3. VERIFY - Assess fraud/default risk via Signal, Beacon, Trust Index
4. ACT - Make decision with explainable factors and audit trail

"In an agentic world, the underlying data and the underlying identity 
source—those are gonna become two of the most crucial elements."
